# Class-Automation
I made a Python Script to attend my Online Classes Everyday. You can optionally add the executable file to Windows Scheduler to run it daily automatically.

NOTE: YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE MAIN EXECUTION FILE HERE : https://mega.nz/file/qgpz1CyQ#_Dh4U4Vw7IGD-D5RCr9iN6UzMwznlZJsF40Uu2taCDM

Requirements :
1. Set display resolution to 1366*768 (Other resolutions need customization)
2. Everything else must be closed properly
3. Mouse and keyboard activities during the execution of the file may cause problems
4. Don't set your mouse cursor initially at a corner [To overcome this issue, disable Failsafe]
5. Only Chrome and Firefox are currently supported
6. You must be a student of KPS,Barasat

Warnings:
1. If you have multiple displays, make sure that the script runs on your default display
2. Incomplete loading of a page may rarely cause the program to break. If it does, close the console and re-run
